## Workshop Description

Concepts of causal inference in epidemiology have important ramifications for studies across bioinformatics and other fields of health research. In this workship, we introduce basic concepts of epidemiology, study design, and causal inference for bioinformaticians. Emphasis is placed on addressing bias and confounding as common threats to assessing a causal pathway in a variety of study design types and when using common forms of analyses such as GWAS and survival analysis. Workshop participants will have the opportunity to create their own structural causal models (DAGs) and use this model to determine how to assess an estimated causal effect. Examples using DESeq2, edgeR, and limma will be used to show how multivariable models can be fitted depending on the hypothesized causal relationship. 

## Pre-requisites

* Basic knowledge of R syntax
* Familiarity with regression

## Workshop Participation

Students will have the opportunity to solve toy problems and execute example code in R.

## _R_ / _Bioconductor_ packages used

* dagitty
* DESeq2
* edgeR
* limma

```{r}
library(dagitty)
```

## Workshop goals and objectives

## Learning goals

* Describe the differences in common experimental and observational study designs
* Apply concepts of study design to common analyses in bioinformatics such as GWAS and survival analysis
* Understand key concepts of epidemiology such as causal inference, confounders, collidors, mediators, counterfactuals, and study designs
* Develop a structural causal diagram/directed acyclic graph (DAG) of causal relationships and assess pathways of interest
* Recognize the limitations and assumptions of multivariable regression in observational studies, and how this affects common analyses such as DESeq2, edgeR, and limma

## Learning objectives

* Assess a study design in terms of causal inference
* Learn about path blocking to prevent confounding
* Create a DAG in R using daggity
* Identify situations when multivariate adjustment for variables is inappropriate
* Select the correct model formula/matrix in DESeq2, edgeR, or limma to deconfound

## Introduction: Just what is a cause anyway?

Requisite boring dictionary definition:

> something that brings about an effect or a result (Merriam-Webster)

This doesn't tell us much though in terms of identifying a cause. How do we know our potential cause brought about an effect or a result? Perhaps it preceded the effect of interest. However, it could still just be a coincidence. Perhaps there is a lurking second cause that causes both our potential cause and the observed effect.

## The counterfactual definition of a cause
Rather than relying on vague dictionary definitions, the most commonly accepted definition of a cause in modern epidemiology is based on a counterfactual: *what would have happened had the event of interest not occurred*.

But that's not very intuitive or easy to parse so let's consider an example:

### Example: A dog and an ambulance
An ambulance drives by a house with its sirens on. A dog in the house barks. We can ask the causal question in a straightforward way: Did the ambulance driving by the house cause the dog to bark? 

Alternatively, we can rephrase the question in terms of a counterfactual: Would the dog have barked if the ambulance had not driven by the house? We can visualize the relationship using a causal diagram also called a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

```{r}
cd1 <- dagitty( "dag {
  Ambulance -> Dog_Barking
}")
coordinates(cd1) <- list(x=c(Ambulance=1, Dog_Barking=2),
                         y=c(Ambulance=0, Dog_Barking=0))
plot(cd1)
```
This diagram depicts the cause (the ambulance) and the effect (the dog barking) with an arrow indicating the direction of the causal relationship. In contrast to a diagram showing a statistical relationship, causal diagrams must state a directional relationship.

## Confounding
Confounding arises when a third variable is present in the relationship between cause-and-effect. A confounder is present when:
1. The confounder causes the outcome
2. The confounder causes the exposure
3. The confounder is not a mediator (i.e. it is not present on the causal pathway between the exposure and the outcome)


Returning to our example, the relationship between the ambulance and the barking dog could be confounded by a third variable: a nearby car crash. Perhaps this car crash is what started the dog barking before the ambulance even arrived, but the ambulance caused the dog to bark even more.

```{r}
cd2 <- dagitty( "dag {
  Ambulance -> Dog_Barking
  Car_Crash -> Ambulance
  Car_Crash -> Dog_Barking
}")
coordinates(cd2) <- list(x=c(Ambulance=1, Dog_Barking=3, Car_Crash=2),
                         y=c(Ambulance=0, Dog_Barking=0, Car_Crash=1))
plot(cd2)
```
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)


```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
